Soccer

• Learn the basic skills, such as dribbling, passing, shooting, and tackling.

• The ball doesn’t have to hit the back of the net for the goal to count. As soon as the entire ball goes over the line, it’s a goal.

• Be confident and aggressive whenever there’s an opportunity for an open shot, and shoot wide and low to score during a game.
